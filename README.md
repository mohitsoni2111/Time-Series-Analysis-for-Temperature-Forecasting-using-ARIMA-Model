# Time-Series-Analysis-for-Temperature-Forecasting-using-ARIMA-Model.

## Requirements  

* Python 3.5 or higher 
* Numpy 
* Pandas 
* Matplotlib 
* Statsmodels  

## Dataset 

In this project, the Dataset used is the famous Kaggle [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data). 

## Exploratory Data Analysis 

First we use pandas to read the CSV file. After that we perform Data Cleaning such as removing unwanted columns, identifying and filling the missing values.  

##  Checking Time Series Data Stationarity:  

This is achieved using Augmented Dickey-Fuller test which assists finding out the stationary properties in the Time series data.  The stationarity check is carried out using the plot and p-value is tested.

As the p-value is below the threshold value, thus we can reject null-hypothesis which states that the data is not stationary.  

## Modelling and Forecasting Temperature

I used ARIMA model which stands for "Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Averages".  

In this case as the data is stationary therefore only AR and MA have been taken into account.  

Then AIC is calculated and then I found values of p and q having lowest AIC where the p represents the number of Auto-Regressive (AR) terms and q represents the number of Moving Averages (MA) terms.  

After that the results are predicted. Here is the example of results.
